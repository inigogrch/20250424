title: "Tutorial 6: Refactoring R Code"
---

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidymodels)

data <- read_csv("data/penguins.csv")

```

# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Summary statistics
glimpse(data)
readRDS("results/summary-stats.rds")

# Visualizations
knitr::include_graphics("results/penguin_boxplot.png")
```

# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

```{r}
conf_mat <- read_rds("results/conf-mat.rds")
conf_mat

```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
